#TODO in order of ease of doing
- in chat messages overflow out of the chat bubble to the right DONE
- random session error on login(start) page when user first lands there and is not yet logged in
- top right sign-in/sign-up BTN does not update to a sign up, when user goes to the sign-up landing and successfully creates an account and is redirected to the login(start) page
- better error messages when username/E-mail is already taken. eg "this username/E-mail is already taken" kinda Done
- calendar select for Date of Birth
- encrypt all userData so you cant peek at it from localhost/8000/user(password is already encrypted)
- Typing in progress
- message notifications (maybe message icon on unread message, if user is online and gets a message maybe shake that message profile?) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48206791/websockets-with-gorilla-websocket-for-user-notifications
- get embed imgur links to work in posts if possible
